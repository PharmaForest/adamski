##  Adamski
**A SAS package of toolkit for CDISC ADaM creation**
Let's build the spaceship [adamski] together!
PharmaForest is looking for collaborators and contributors to join us on this exciting journey. If you're passionate
about ADaM programming or want to help shape tools for the clinical data community, we'd love to have you onboard! ?
Inspired by the {admiral} package in R, Adamski aims to bring similar functionality to the SAS environment, while introducing original functions and macros.
We strive to maintain consistency by keeping function (macro) and option names as close as possible to their R counterparts.
However, some differences are inevitable due to the distinct nature of SAS and R.
In addition, new functions and macros would be developed to extend the capabilities.
**Please see notice.sas in additional contents(addcnt) in addition to license.sas**

## `%derive_var_merged_exist_flag()` macro <a name="derivevarmergedexistflag-macro-1"></a> ######

### Macro:
    %derive_var_merged_exist_flag

### Purpose:
    Creates a character flag variable indicating whether the current DATA step row's key(s) exist in another dataset. 

### Parameters:

 - `dataset_add` (required) : Dataset to check for existence (e.g., `SDTM.AE`).

 - `by_vars`     (required) : Space-separated list of key variables used for the lookup.

 - `new_var`     (required) : Name of the output flag variable to create (character).

 - `condition`   (optional) : WHERE clause (as text) applied to `dataset_add` before building  the hash (e.g., `%nrbquote(SEX="F")`). If omitted, all rows are used.

 - `true_value`  (optional) : Value assigned to `new_var` when a match is found.
                              Default: `Y`.

 - `false_value` (optional) : Value assigned to `new_var` when no match is found.
                              Default: (blank).

### Sample code

~~~sas
data have;
  do SEX="F","M"; do AGE=12 to 17; output; end; end;
run;

data want;
  set have;
  *Single key;
  %derive_var_merged_exist_flag(
    dataset_add = SASHELP.CLASS,
    by_vars     = AGE,
    new_var     = AGE_IN_CLASS,
    true_value  = Y,
    false_value = N
  );

  * Multiple keys;
  %derive_var_merged_exist_flag(
    dataset_add = SASHELP.CLASS,
    by_vars     = AGE SEX,
    new_var     = AGE_SEX_IN_CLASS
  );

  * With condition ;
  %derive_var_merged_exist_flag(
    dataset_add = SASHELP.CLASS,
    by_vars     = AGE,
    condition   = %nrbquote(SEX="F"),
    new_var     = AGE_IN_CLASS_F_ONLY,
    true_value  = Yes,
    false_value = No
  );
run;
~~~

### Note:

- Parameter `dataset` in {admiral} is not defined taking into account how the macro in SAS is used.  

- Parameter `filter_add' is omitted because SAS's mechanism makes it difficult to differentiate it from the condition parameter. Records filtered by condition are the subject of evaluation.

- Parameter  `missing_value` parameter has not been implemented at this time, as there are currently few practical use cases that come to mind.

## `%derive_vars_dy()` macro <a name="derivevarsdy-macro-2"></a> ######

### Macro:
%derive_vars_dy
### Purpose:
Generates study day (`DY`) variables from given date variables using a specified reference date (e.g., `TRTSDT`).
### Parameters:
- `reference_date` (required)	: Reference date variable (e.g., `TRTSDT`) used as Day 1
- `source_vars` (required)		: Space-separated list of source date variables(--DT) for which DY variables will be derived.
### Sample code:
~~~sas
%derive_vars_dy(
reference_date = TRTSDT,
source_vars     = AESTDT AEENDT
)
~~~
### Note:
- Parameter `dataset` in {admiral} is not defined taking into account how the macro in SAS is used.
- Parameter `source_vars` only accepts date variable while {admiral} accepts datetime variable as well.
In general, it is thought date variables are created before creating day variables.
