##  Adamski

**A SAS package of toolkit for CDISC ADaM creation**
Let's build the spaceship [adamski] together!
PharmaForest is looking for collaborators and contributors to join us on this exciting journey. If you're passionate
about ADaM programming or want to help shape tools for the clinical data community, we'd love to have you onboard! ?
Inspired by the {admiral} package in R, Adamski aims to bring similar functionality to the SAS environment, while introducing original functions and macros.
We strive to maintain consistency by keeping function (macro) and option names as close as possible to their R counterparts.
However, some differences are inevitable due to the distinct nature of SAS and R.
In addition, new functions and macros would be developed to extend the capabilities.
**Please see notice.sas in additional contents(addcnt) in addition to license.sas**

### Main Features
